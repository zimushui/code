//! Shared context sections for synchronous Guardian review and asynchronous scoring.
//!
//! Transcript collection and bounded host-owned history are also available directly,
//! without section composition.
//! Contributor failures abort collection without returning partial context.
//! Sections carry structured transcript evidence without depending on either
//! consumer's rendering, retention, compaction, or request lifecycle.
//! Registered contributors declare their scope once and are collected only for
//! matching context consumers. History and collection settings are borrowed for
//! each request so the default registry can be reused without retaining state.
